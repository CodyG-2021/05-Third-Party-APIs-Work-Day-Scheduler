# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

A simple work day planner

The goal of this site is to create a work day planner that will show you the current day and depending on the hour of day will show you what current time block it is and what entries are in the past an future. 

To use the planner simply go to the time block you want to enter a memo on and click the text area. Once you enter the memo click the save button to the right and you will be alerted that it has been saved. If you refresh the page the memos will still be there. 

Below is a screen shot of the planner:
